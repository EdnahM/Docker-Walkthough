Slide 3: The Problem We're Solving
"It Works on My Machine" 🤷‍♂️
Before Containers:
❌ Different environments (dev, test, prod)
❌ Dependency conflicts
❌ "Works on my laptop but not on server"
❌ Complex deployments
❌ Resource waste
With Containers:
✅ Same environment everywhere
✅ All dependencies included
✅ Consistent deployments
✅ Efficient resource usage
✅ Easy scaling

Slide 4: What is a Container?
Think of it Like a Shipping Container 📦
Physical Shipping Container:

Standard size and shape
Contents are isolated
Can be moved anywhere
Stackable and efficient

Software Container:

Standard runtime environment
Application + dependencies isolated
Runs anywhere Docker is installed
Lightweight and efficient

Container = Application + Everything it needs to run

Slide 5: Container vs Virtual Machine
